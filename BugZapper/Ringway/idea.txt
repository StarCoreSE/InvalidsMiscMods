- add MVSP cool particle effect at center of area when jumping (and receiving?)
- broadcast into chat?
- need admin comps
- could flesh it out more, or have it just be an admin only thing
- use an action relay and send a signal to...X to jump
- faction variation might be cool, if there's time and it works.
